# AI Mental Wellbeing Agent Team ðŸ§ 

The AI Mental Wellbeing Agent Team is a supportive mental health assessment and guidance system powered by [AG2](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2?tab=readme-ov-file)(formerly AutoGen)'s AI Agent framework. This app provides personalized mental health support through the coordination of specialized AI agents, each focusing on different aspects of mental health care based on user inputs such as emotional state, stress levels, sleep patterns, and current symptoms.
